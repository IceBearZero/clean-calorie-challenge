# The Clean Calorie Challenge
Lets group up and eat **Clean Calories** for short time period. See how we feel, recieve postive feedback from others doing it and walk away with a different perspective of how we choose and consume food!

# Why
**Why not?** We eat deliscious foods every day, often times without thinking about their consequences. Why not make some conscious, well constrained choices for a short time to train ourselves into a different way to think about of food decisions?

# Motivation
Every once in a while I look at my food choices over a day or a week and really question where my decisions, will-power, or self control come into play. In the past I've chosed a per day 'rule' to follow:

- No Meat Monday (Lets be vegetarian for a day)
- No Snack Tueday (stay out of the start-up pantry!)
- Wheat Free Wednesday (no carbs basically)
- etc

I found that over time, keeping these decisions at the top of my eating choices I built up a better Meta-self-awareness[1] on days that there were no rules. It was a fun game, that extended into better habits - but at the same time deteriorated quickly if forgotten.

The Clean Calorie Challenge is just a new twist on being responsible for my eating choices. 

# The Rules

- If this isn't fun, then you are making this overly complex
- Round up a group of people that want to partake
- Pick a timeframe (Monday Breakfast though Friday Lunch [Celebrate the week Friday night!])
- Try to do daily check in with how yesterday went
- Show positive support for others in the group
- Follow the guidelines as best you can.
- Remember, as long as you wake up feeling you succeeded the day before, its a success!

# Daily Check-in with the group

Check-in with the group, let everyone know how you kicked ass yesterday and feel absolutely awesome about it! As a group rally behind this and give some virtual high fives, hugs and accolades. 

Be honest with yourself and the group. If you happened to slip and missed the goal yesterday, acknowledge it, take a minute and think about why you fell short and what you could have done better. Remember that today is a new day and you actually do get to hit the reset switch. Don't use yesterday as an excuse for today! 

As a group, show support - in other words, *Don't be dicks* - this shit is hard!

# Guidleines
Remember these are just some stupid rules a person on the internet threw together. If something sounds silly, don't do it. Just make sure whatever guidelines you are following actually require you to think through the food choice you are about to make!

## Plain and simple
Raw foods only. This includes fresh vegetables, fruits and nuts. I'm sure I've left something off. You figure it out.
 
### Raw means raw
You can't cook these items. The *gray* area is olive oil and vinegars. If a nice healthy fresh guacomole sounds delightfully clean, raw and deliscious - **Do it**
 
## One cheat per day
Yep - we are human, we make mistakes or have needs. You get one close a blind eye per day. There is, however, a catch to the cheat. The cheat can only be a single serving. In other words, that bag of chips you got, check the label and only eat the acceptable single serving.
 
 This is mainly for those that need their morning coffee or they should not be let loose in public - but use it at your discretion.
 
 # Final Thought
 Use this short challenge to think about what you are eating and to reach the goal. When the challenge is over, try to maintain some of the Meta-self-awareness as you decide what you should eat and if you should take that next bite.
