# The Clean Calorie Challenge

Every once in a while I look at my food choices over a day or a week and really question where my decisions, will-power, or self control come into play. In the past I've chosed a per day 'rule' to follow:

- No Meat Monday (Lets be vegetarian for a day)
- No Snack Tueday (stay out of the start-up pantry!)
- Wheat Free Wednesday (no carbs basically)
- etc

I found that keeping these decisions at the top of all my eating choices that over time I built up a better Meta-self-awareness[1] on days that there were no rules. It was a fun game, that extended into better habits - but at the same time deteriorated quickly if forgotten.

Now I would like to just do a focused effort on eating **Clean Calories** for a short amount of time. 

# The Rules

- If this isn't fun, then you are making this overly complex
- Round up a group of people that want to partake
- Pick a timeframe (Monday Breakfast though Friday Lunch [Celebrate the week Friday night!])
- Try to do daily check in with how yesterday went
- Show support to others in the group
- Follow the guidelines as best you can. 
 - But remember, as long as you wake up thinking you succeeded the day before, its a success!

# Daily Check-in with the group

If you successfully completed the prior days goal, let everyone know. As a group rally behind this and give some virtual high fives, lhugs and accolades. If you happened to slip and missed the goal yesterday, acknowledge it, take a minute and think about why you fell short and what you could have done better. Remember that today is a new day and you actually do get to hit the reset switch. Don't user yesterday as an excuse for today! As a group, show support - in other words, *Don't be dicks* - this shit is hard!

# Guidleines
Remember these are just some stupid rules a person on the internet threw together. If something sounds silly, don't do it, Just make sure whatever guidelines you are following actually require you to think through the food choice you are about to make!

Raw foods only. This includes fresh vegetables, fruits and nuts. I'm sure I've left something off. 
 
 ## Raw means raw
 You can't cook these items. The *gray* area is olive oil and vinegars. If a nice healthy fresh guacomole sounds delightfully clean, raw and deliscious - **Do it**
 
 ## One cheat per day
 Yep - we are human, we make mistakes or have needs. You get one close a blind eye per day. There is, however, a catch to the cheat. The cheat can only be a single serving. In other words, that bag of chips you got, check the label and only eat the acceptable single serving.
 
 This is mainly for those that need their morning coffee or they should not be let loose in public - but use it at your discretion.
